# Big 5 Factor Analysis and Psychographic Profiling:

As a social psychologist who has previously conducted exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in SPSS, R and MATLAB, the purpose of this project is to practice these skills using Python and its relevant libraries.  This project is still a work in progress.

- multiple variables have similar patterns of responses because they are all associated with a latent variable that is multifaceted and can't be measured directly (e.g., personality traits, depression, ethnic/racial identity).


- test and validate scale development 


- data dimensionality reduction techinque: find a smaller number of interpretable factors that explain the maximum amount variability in the data
